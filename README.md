# OIBSIP – AICTE Oasis Infobyte Internship Tasks
This repository contains all the completed tasks from the AICTE Oasis Infobyte Internship Program, focused on Cybersecurity & Information Security.
It includes practical labs, security reports, documentation, analysis exercises, and network traffic investigations performed during the internship.
The goal of this repository is to serve as a documented showcase of the projects, tools, and skills developed throughout the program.

## 📌 Internship Summary
The Oasis Infobyte internship covered a wide range of cybersecurity concepts through hands-on implementation, research-based tasks, and analysis-driven documentation. </br>
Key areas explored:
- Network Security
- Packet Capture Analysis (Wireshark)
- Threat Identification & Classification
- Patch & Vulnerability Management
- Human-Centric Security (Social Engineering)
- Cyber Awareness & Defense Principles </br>
Each task was completed individually and documented with clarity, including analysis, screenshots (where applicable), and structured reports.

## 📁 Repository Contents
Below is a detailed breakdown of the files and tasks included in this repository. </br>
