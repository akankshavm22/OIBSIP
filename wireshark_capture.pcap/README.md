This video demonstrates:
- Setting up Wireshark for packet capture
- Selecting the correct network interface
- Capturing live network traffic
- Filtering packets using Wireshark display filters
- Understanding key protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP, ICMP, ARP, etc.)
- Analyzing packet headers and payload structures
- Exporting capture results for reporting or documentation

## 🧰 Tools Used

| Tool               | Description                                                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wireshark          | Open-source network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect packets. |
| Windows 10/11      | Operating system used for the demonstration.                       |
| Browser/Applications | Used to generate traffic for packet capture.                      |

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of the video, you will understand how to:
- Select and configure network interfaces for packet capture
- Capture live network traffic
- Apply Wireshark display filters
- Analyze protocol layers (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, HTTP, DNS, etc.)
- Inspect packet headers and payloads
- Export captured data for reporting

## 🔍 Useful Wireshark Filters (Examples)
<pre> 
  http
  tcp
  udp
  icmp
  dns
  arp
  tcp.port == 80
  ip.addr == x.x.x.x
</pre>

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download the video from this repository.
2. Open Wireshark on your system.
3. Follow along with the demonstration.
4. Try capturing similar traffic on your local network.
5. Use the filters shown to analyze packets.
6. Document your findings for academic or internship reporting.
